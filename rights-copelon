Itimate Violence - Rhonda Copelon

Domestic Violence is just as prevalent in 1st world as 3rd.
	38% of women murdered were killed by partners
	42% of women experience intimate violence

Effects:
	- Alcoholism, Birth Defects, STDs

World Health Organization Recommendation
	- Eliminate tolerence for violence
	- Better support for women (all around)
	- Need for better reporting mechanisms for violence

Copelon equates all aspects of torture to intimate violence.
	- Jim and Molly example
	- Implement awareness on a global setting

Critical Elements of Torture
	- Pain (psychological and physical)
	- Intentional
	- Perceived Purpose
	- Official support

Should this private matter be publicly protected?
	- There are some gray lines
	- Some people feel ashamed
	- Comparison to torture makes the line less gray in IMO
	- Without concrete proof, it's easy to say heresay

How close must you be to the relationship?
	- Sometimes you don't know when to step in 
	- There are lots of "reasons" to stay in the relationship
	  that are tough to understand
	- going into someone's relationship is hella hard

How can legislation affect change?
	- How can you prove mental abuse?
	- Lighter sentences for men than for other violent crimes
		> increase punishment
	- Increase understanding for how to acquire help
		> But there's a fear that something WORSE will happen
		> Alas, the fear will always exist
		> It can be difficult and ashaming to talk to the
		  police
	- Teaching and changing the gender stereotypes
		> Educate support system, aka
		> Mental help for abuser
		> Education is an uphill battle though, it's sort of 
		  a zero sum game... and takes
	- Blame society, always easy, but that action is not easy
	- Ask the abused what then need, what would help them more

Does economics matter?
	- Maybe more of a value system than economics
	- People look to acquire power and that's the driver
	- And now nature v nurture
	- A power difference or disconnect can fester this violence
		> Empower women to help change this power difference

A history of abuse means it will continue 
	- I wonder if that's a truth. 
	- Probs not.
	
We often ignore psychological abuse, thoughts?
	- the torture comparison helps understand psychological abuse	 

Is there a way to financially help victims?

*REMEMBER: abuse isn't a one time thing*
