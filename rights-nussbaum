She has a goal of utilizing Kantian ethical philosophy to prove
 the imperative of feminism. NICE

I liked where she was going, even liking the idea of forming a list of what 'makes people human,' until she put the list down. It seemed a bit fabricated IMO. The list seems to have overlap (though OP doesn't think so) and some very high qualifications for human life.

We shall see.

Good on OP to make the distinction between functioning and capability. Back on board. Having the ability to do something to be an end is far different from having to exercise said capabilities.

The language of functioning and capabilities is a really solid supplement to rights. Nussbaum hits on this and has it right, I think. It adds some power and reason to rights. Also a metric for determining if rights are satisfied outside of mere paper laws.

This framework of capabilities is a way of determining what a person should be ABLE to do regardless of what they THINK they want to do. A key distinction because there are plenty of cultures and people who don't desire to change. We want to allow that while giving them the ability to change.

Disadvantage: It sure is hard to calcuate capabilities in any way.
