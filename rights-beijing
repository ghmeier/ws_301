Beyond Beijing.

4th international women's conference. 30k attendees.

The Plan for Action -
	- the official plan for improving women's status worldwide
	- focuses on removing barriers from women participating equally
	- "strongest document on women's rights ever"

My main question on the conference is:

What actually happened? 
	Public agreement to support the action plan
	Implementation is questionable though

	- What are the results?

Why China?
Do we still have problems the delegates were passionate about?
What the world bank?

Why hasn't there been another conference?
	- UN, countries, funding just isn't there.
	- is there less progress because we haven't had another one.
	- maybe there are better avenues of change.
