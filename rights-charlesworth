Some notes:
> Mere equality of rights is not necessarily sufficient.
	- "Men and women are running different races"
> Starting with Int'l women's rights presented huge difficulties

> Sometimes pushing for rights has kickbacks. i.e. not helping women

> Equal Rights act not a part of the constitution.

> Central article theme was that women suffer in spheres that simply aren't regulated
	- is it certainly law or lack of law?
	- can culture play a role in shaping women's roles?

> Some countries have no ability to enforce laws
	- is that a role of International Human Rights?

> Interesting that the discussion starts being male v female right away.

> Essentialism: You can end up thinking a solution for you personally, is not necessarily broadly applicable.

> An underresourced or underrepresented movement is not addressed.
	- if there aren't enough resources, you just can't fight all the battles.
	- asking more of the same is not always the solution

> When does the domestic sphere require regulation?
	- there are some matters that should be viewed as private
	- others need governmental regulation (torture, violence, etc.)

> To defend a certain individual right, the gov't might have to violate cultural or religious rights.
