What barriers do they face?
	getting and maintaining a job
	discrimination of the working class
	just being a minority :(
	children are tough to schedule around
	lack of education (housing taxes fund schools, better area = better school)
	
Was her experience skewed?
	lack of pressure
	didn't feel as trapped
	had a support system which people just don't have

How would it have been different if she were a man?
	more physical labor
	requires fewer skills
	less likely to be dehumanized
	safety is less of an issue
	
As you gain power, you lose empathy.
	- disrespectful managers
	- forget what it's like to be working poor

Stereotypes negatively affect people...
