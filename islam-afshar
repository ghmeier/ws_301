Let's talk about western values clashing with Islamic values:

Western women don't cover up and are subject to unrealistic beauty standards
Islamic women cover themselves and don't have to worry about going outside
	- That's the argument OP brings up
	- Does it have merit?

What are some of the rights she gave in order to support her argument?
	- Islam as a religion looks to accommodate women's specific needs
	- Khadija asked the Prophet first to marry her
	- Marriage was a contract between consenting partners
	
Take a look at Nussbaum. Western women have the ability to choose
	whether or not there's a pressure. In Islamic states, institutions
	control what women are able or capable of doing.

Islamic women in the workplace?
	- Women are seen as having specific jobs.
	- Even women lawmakers are limiting the rights of women

Women are being marginalized because they are being made invisible in policy

Women are the guardians of honour, so they must not travel to other countries
	- this seems like a pretty big stretch to me...

What are general thoughts?
	- It's cool to get a different perspective
	- Definitely has value and merit
		> pointing out objectification is a pretty solid point
