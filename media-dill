Video Game Characters and the Socialization of Gender Roles: Young People's Perceptions Mirror Sexist Media Depictions
	- Karen Dill

Male +83% aggressive +1% Sexual
Female +83% aggressive +60% sexual

 - Teens think men are aggressive and woman are sex objects

What do you think about gender representations in video games?
How is gender often denoted in characters? What about non-human characters?
Does advancing technology or the drive of the media affect gender roles more?

 - "Banking on the popularity of video games among men, US Army spends $4 million on their video game" 
Does that seem like an accurate representation? I'm skeptical

How do you think gender is negatively portrayed in video games?

 - Lots of connections being made between watching things and bad consequences
 - Media impacts acceptance of attractiveness norms "curvaceously thin"
 - **Females exposed to attractive females downgraded their self-worth, while males exposed to dominance downed their self-worth**
 	- AKA failure to live up to sex stereotypes downgrades social desirability

In what ways does the media negatively impact personal perceptions?
How are video games different than other forms of media in their depiction of gender stereotypes?
How do video games affect people differently?
Can they be used positively?
Why are negative archetypes used to depict characters in video games?

 - While there certainly is a lot of research cited here, it seems like there's quite a bit of causal blame put on video games when there is only evidence for correlation
 	- just have to be sure not to conflate the two

Why does the author say negative gender portrayals in video games harmful?

- Gerbner's Cultivation Theory - exposure to mass media creates a worldview closer to the media's distortion than with reality
- Ambivalent Sexism Theory - people are benevolent and hostile simultaneously based on the media's attitude towards each sex.
	 - essentially, the media condenses the best and worst stereotypes
- Hegemonic Masculinity Theory - masculinity and femininity are always constructed in relation to each other rather than independantly


Two investigations:
Study 1:
	Select top 6 video game magazines
	Investigate market and demographic stats for each
	93% male, avg age 26
	1 male, 1 female image per page
	87% were video game characters, others were ads
	High levels of agreement
	Findings:
	 - Women were more sexualized
	 - Both were aggressive males more so
	 - women often "visions of beauty"
	 - stereotypes are often repeated
Study 2:
	20 males, 29 females, 17-19 y/o
	15 minute survey w/ open ended questions
	1.8h of video games/week
	Males: strong, powerful, aggressive, hostile, athletic
	Females: curvaceous, sexual, aggressive
	Perceptions are similar to portrayals

Are the studies' findings surprising? Why or why not?
 - I feel like the study doesn't really say much. Perceptions are similar to portrayals isn't a very strong point to make.

 - Aggression for males isn't unilaterally a good thing. It implies diminished intelligence

 "Both studies showed that males are given greater respect than females in video games."
