What is Development?
	- Social Change
		> Leads to benefit for others
		> Large institutions invest in smaller countries
		> Gives countries ability to restructure their economy
	- Changing Economic Assumptions

The Origin Story:
	- WWII just ended
		> Econ is very material based
		> process raw goods and sell finished goods
		> SPOILER ALERT: it's not like that anymore
		> ^ that's economic development.
	- Int'l orgs get created (U.N, world bank, IMF)
	- Modernization theory started when U.S entered stage as a superpower
		> Many countries borrowed to keep up
		> poorest countries go from $25 bil to $523 bil in dept
	** MODERNIZATION **
		> If countries follow modernization stages, everyone can be
		  at a high level.
		> Stages:
			+ Traditional Society - subsistence living & ag
			+ Transitional Stage - more specialization, increase trade
			  entrepreneurs emerge, move to urban areas
			+ Take-off - Industrialization increases, workers move to 
			  specialized jobs, investment goes hella up
			+ Drive to Maturity - econ diversification, tech innivation
			+ High Consumption - THE GOAL (for some reason or another)
		> But can everyone truly consume highly??
			+ Some communities/cultures don't want that progress
	- Criticized for being "Westernization"
		> Creates a monetary dependancy on bigger countries
		> Allows large countries to oppress the weak
		> Tried this before (aka colonialism)
		> It's only pseudo-power
	- In any case, big countries gave $$ to small countries to help
	  modernize them. 
	
Three dev theories:
	(WID) Women in Development
		- Esther Boserup (1970) researched the role of women in econ dev.
		- Found that women weren't part of the econ values
		- Modernization resulted in gendered division of labor, didn't
		  help with dev.
		- And the response is to tack women onto existing programs.
		- Of course it used an essentialist view though
	(WAD) Women and Development
		- Assumes women have always been active in development
		- States that paid and unpaid labor of women is essential
		- Women's oppression is part of int'l system of oppression
	(GAD) Gender and Development
		- Emphasizes global power and resource sharing as a cause for
		  inequality.
		- People of all sorts are affected by globalized system
		- There's a system of power exploiting people in general

Debt Crisis :(
	Structural Adjustment Policies (SAP)
		- Forces countries to make drastic change to their rules and economy
	Affect on women
		- lower quality of live
		- educated and undedicated women are  moving in search of better
		  livelihoods
		- but, because of their societal position, women supply cheap labor
		- cuts gov't funding for women and children's programs

Current Impacts of SAP's
	- Women are leaving home to search for economic opportunities

Gender Mainstreaming (GM)
	- Instead of giving money to a gov't for development, organizations will
	  put restrictions on $$ for specific actions
	  	> aka, giving money as long as a percentage goes to womens issues
		> or women are allowed to be policy-makers
	- Women are included in all aspects of gov't
		> this is a big ol thumbs up!
	- Benefits:
		> Shows exactly how bad colonization and modernization were for 
		  women
		> Empowered women to question political, religious institutions
		> New movements and activism across the world

Women in the Environment
	- 1970 Oil Crisis
		> OPEC was mad at the west for helping Israel so they held oil
		  hostage, like the jerk they are.
		> at least it made peoplev plan for the energy future
	- Env concerns coincided with WID
		> grew women's interest in ag & env
	- 1985 Nairobi Conf on women in Dev
		> Got women involved in environmental policy!
		> seminal achievement on Women, Evn, and Sustainable Dev (WED)
		> Showed how women were already involved in env protection
	- Rejects western model of dev
	- EcoFeminism
		> Mies (1986) reproduction & provision defines women's closeness
		  to nature
		> Women don't work in nature because they ARE nature

Whether it's through Colonializm or Globalization/Modernization, women are uniquely
  affected by economic change or western progress. As a result, differing policies
  are necessary for addressing women's needs
