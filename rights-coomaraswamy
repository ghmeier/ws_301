To Bellow Like a Cow -

Shows the inequalities with women and local values.
	Highlighted the difference in women's rights between women.
	Once again the theme of difficulty of making concrete laws across cultures.

Four Case Studies about Barriers
	1 Sati-Case: 
	2 Hodood Ordinance:  
	3 Shah Bano: Hundu indian woman was denied divorce help because of muslim majority
		- good reminder that sometines the local culture can be better than imposed
		  culture (in Sri Lanka, Native American Peoples)

How should international laws be created?
	Remember that everyone isn't western
	Maybe try some education
		- leads to jobs
		- increases quality of life
		- women tend to prioritize children

Even though change needs to start with culture, law needs to get it started.
	address violence, discrimination
	you have to at least make a step
		- requires empowerment 
		- get women in government or speaking out
	make it ok to defend women's rights as human rights

Prievious world conferences on women:
	Mexico City, 1975
		- 133 gov'ts (some couldn't send a woman as the representative)
		- 6,000 NGO representatives 
		- Topics:
			> Full gender equality, pay, rights, etc. (the west)
			> integration of women in development (developing countries)
			> allowing women to contribute to world peace (because Cold War)
			> very western women's issues, which is :/
	Copenhagen, 1980
		- 145 gov'ts
		- Topics: 
			> Equality of employment
			> Improving women's health and availability of health
			> giving women access to education
		- Program of Action: stressed stronger national measures to ensure 
		  women's ownership of property.
	Nairobi, 1985
		- 1657 gov'ts 
		- 1.9k participants
		- Topics:
			> make women participants in environmental concerns
				- gives women import in agrerian societies
	Beijing, 1995
		- 189 gov'ts represented
			> Adopted Beijing Declaration <of something or other>
			> That's ALL the UN countries
		- 30k women
		- 12 areas of concern on international issues
		
"The Rights Discourse is the weakest discourse."
	- In Group bias is stronger than anything else (aka culture)
	- requires majority support for implementation
	- implementing new policy is a helluva lot harder than following the norm.

There's been quite a bit of change in the western world regarding women. 
	Keep in mind avoiding an essentialist view
		- I like this because it provides value to western women's issues
		  while still giving the ability to talk about other countries' 
		  other issues.
