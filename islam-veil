To veil or not to veil?
Jen'nan Ghazal Read

Case study of women who veil and don't veil

Reasons to veil:
	- more confidence
	- feel more like themselves
	- protection from a male gaze
	- 'men can't control it'

Reasons not to veil:
	- Felt it's a symbol of patriarchy
	- Wanted to be independent of men
	- 'men choose not to control it'

U.S. is very different than the mid-east
	- we have the luxury of making the choice

Can seem like a barrier to a person
	- but that's their choice
	- trouble can come where there's judgement back on people who don't wear scarves

Europe has a problem because they want people to integrate rather than express their culture.

Catering to men with the hijab is still catering.
	- Still puts restrictions on yourself.

Men can't control their sexuality, but women  must control theirs. 
	- it's important to discuss sexuality openly and frankly
	- victim blaming culture is prevalent in the US as well
	- why regulate what people are wearing?

hijabs don't stop sexual assault.

Sometimes it's a respect thing. 
	respect people who are part of the religion and wear it all the time
